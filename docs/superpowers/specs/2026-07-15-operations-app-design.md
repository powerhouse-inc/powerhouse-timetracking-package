# Powerhouse Operations App — Design

**Date:** 2026-07-15
**Status:** Approved (Phase 0 detailed; later phases outlined)

## Goal

Turn this package (`powerhouse-timetracking-package`) from a time-tracking tool into a
complete **operations app** for the Powerhouse team, covering four subsystems in one
Next.js app:

- **Time** — existing (`timetracking-workspace`, `timesheet`)
- **Sales** — `lead-funnel` (from `../testproject`)
- **Delivery** — `scope-of-work` (from `../project-management`)
- **Billing** — the 7-model contributor-billing suite (from `../contributor-billing`)

Because it is an open-source package, other teams can run their own operations app from
the same code — there must be **no hardcoded Powerhouse-specific data**; the
`timetracking-workspace` document *is* the tenant configuration.

## Model inventory (11 total after import)

| Layer | Models | Relationship to workspace |
|---|---|---|
| Master data | `timetracking-workspace` (clients, projects, members) | it **is** the master directory |
| Time | `timesheet` | `TimeEntry.projectId → Project.id` (OID) |
| Sales | `lead-funnel` | weak — `company`, `owner` are free text |
| Delivery | `scope-of-work` (deliverables, roadmaps, milestones, projects, contributors) | strong — its `Project`, contributor `Agent` (PHID), and **Hours** budget unit map to tracked hours |
| Billing | `invoice`, `billing-statement`, `accounts`, `account-transactions`, `expense-report`, `snapshot-report`, `operational-hub-profile` | contributor identity (PHID), currencies |

## Architecture decisions (approved)

1. **Copy models as-is.** These models are heavy and well-tested (invoice has UBL +
   Request Finance + Gnosis rails; snapshot has flow-categorization; expense-report has a
   chart-of-accounts tree). Rewriting their schemas to hard-wire shared foreign keys would
   be large and risky. Preserve reducers, tests, and upgrades intact.

2. **Unify in the app's data layer.** The `timetracking-workspace` is the single source of
   truth for **who** (members/contributors), **which customer** (clients), and **what
   work** (projects). Every new-subsystem UI lets the user pick a workspace
   client/project/member and stores that identifier on the new document. Where a model
   lacks a link field, add exactly **one** minimal optional field via the MCP two-step —
   nothing more — and do it in the phase that consumes it.

3. **App surface only.** The standalone Next.js app in `app/` is the polished product.
   Connect editors are copied so documents remain editable in Connect, but are not
   polished ("copy but don't polish").

4. **Import mechanism: file-copy + `ph generate`.** The four packages are on different
   tooling versions (this repo `6.2.0-dev.13`; testproject `6.0.0`; contributor-billing &
   project-management `6.2.0-dev.34`). `gen/` folders are therefore **not** copied — only
   the source (`.json` spec, `v1/src/` reducers, `tests/`, `upgrades/`) is copied, and
   `gen/` is rebuilt locally with this repo's `ph generate`. This deviates from the
   CLAUDE.md MCP-first rule; the deviation is justified because we are importing
   pre-specified models wholesale, not authoring new ones (MCP op-replay of 9 complex
   models is not reasonable).

## Delivery decomposition

Each phase is a separate spec → plan → build cycle.

- **Phase 0 — Foundation** (detailed below): import all 9 models + all editors; green build.
- **Phase 1 — Sales:** app "Sales" section — lead pipeline (kanban + list), leads linked to
  workspace clients. Simplest slice; establishes the "new subsystem in the app" pattern.
- **Phase 2 — Delivery:** app "Delivery" section — scope-of-work, with the flagship
  integration: **budgeted hours (SOW) vs. tracked hours (timesheets) per project.**
- **Phase 3 — Billing:** app "Billing" section — Invoices, Billing Statements,
  Accounts/Transactions ledger, Expense & Snapshot reports, Hub Profile. Largest; likely
  its own sub-slices.

Each feature phase adds a role-gated sidebar group and follows the existing app pattern:
read query + `<model>Api` mutate object in `app/lib/api.ts`, `useX()` polling hook in
`app/lib/hooks.ts`, view types in `app/lib/types.ts`, a page under `app/app/(app)/`, and a
gated `NavItem` in `app/components/sidebar.tsx`.

## Phase 0 — Foundation (detailed)

### Scope

All 9 new models and all their editors live in this package, registered and building
clean. **No app UI. No schema changes.**

### Models to import (9)

`lead-funnel`, `scope-of-work`, `invoice`, `billing-statement`, `accounts`,
`account-transactions`, `expense-report`, `operational-hub-profile`, `snapshot-report`.

### Editors to import + heavy deps to resolve

| Editor(s) | Dependency weight |
|---|---|
| lead-funnel board | light (drag/drop only) |
| scope-of-work sidebar | `@powerhousedao/builder-profile` (remote profile fetch) |
| invoice | **heaviest** — react-pdf, UBL, Request Finance, Gnosis, chunked upload |
| accounts, account-transactions | Alchemy SDK |
| expense-report | react-pdf |
| snapshot-report | balance-calc utils |
| drive editors: `contributor-billing`, `builder-team-admin` | dashboard shells |

### Per-model import procedure

1. Copy `document-models/<model>/` **excluding `v1/gen/`**: the `.json` spec, `v1/src/`,
   `tests/`, `upgrades/`, `index.ts`.
2. Run `ph generate` to rebuild `gen/` against `dev.13`.
3. Verify `document-models/index.ts` and `document-models/document-models.ts` register the
   model (codegen appends; fix manually if not).
4. Copy `editors/<editor>/`, add to `editors/editors.ts`, install the deps it imports.

### Import order (increasing risk)

1. **lead-funnel** — spike: validates the copy → `ph generate` → register → green pipeline
   on the simplest, lowest-dep model (and the oldest tooling version, `6.0.0`).
2. **scope-of-work** — one remote-profile editor dep.
3. **billing suite** (7 models) — heaviest deps and `dev.34` origin; editors last.

### No schema changes

Unification linking-fields (e.g. `lead-funnel.Lead.clientId`) are **deferred** to the
consuming feature phase, where they are used and testable. Phase 0 changes zero schemas.

### Primary risk & mitigation

**Risk:** billing editors were authored against `dev.34` and pull `@powerhousedao/common`
/ `builder-tools` / `scalars` at `dev.34`, which may peer-conflict with this repo's
`dev.13` core.
**Mitigation:** import in the risk order above; tackle editor deps last. If a `dev.34`
editor dependency is irreconcilable with `dev.13`, **stub/quarantine that one editor**
(keep its model green and registered) and flag it in the phase summary rather than block
the phase. Reducer/schema version drift (`6.0.0`/`dev.34` → `dev.13`) is fixed by
regenerating `gen/` and adjusting reducers to the `dev.13` generated types where they
differ.

### Verification gate

- `npm run tsc` — clean
- `npm run lint:fix` — clean
- `npm run test:coverage` — ≥95% lines/branches/functions/statements on all reducers
  (imported models ship their own tests; keep them and their coverage)
- `ph generate` — reproducible (re-running produces no diff)
- Every imported model exported from the `document-models` barrel; every editor present in
  `editors/editors.ts`
- (Optional, house-rule-style) load the package in Vetra and confirm each model registers

### Out of scope for Phase 0

App UI, sidebar changes, data-layer additions, unification linking-fields, processors, and
subgraphs for the new models. All handled in later phases.
